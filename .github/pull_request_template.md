## PR CHECKLIST
- [ ] Does the new code adhere to the overall system architecture and design patterns?
- [ ] Is the code modular and reusable rather than tightly coupled?
- [ ] Are database schema changes (if any) properly designed for scalability and efficiency?
- [ ] Does the code introduce unnecessary complexity that could be simplified?
- [ ] Are there potential issues with concurrency, race conditions, or thread safety?
- [ ] Does the new implementation introduce technical debt that should be addressed?
- [ ] Are dependencies correctly managed and used efficiently?
- [ ] Does the solution align with existing business logic and domain models?
- [ ] If this PR modifies API behavior, are consumers of the API properly accounted for?
- [ ] Is the new code optimized for horizontal/vertical scaling?
